# Rotate 2D Matrix

- This project implements an algorithm to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise **in-place** using Python. The solution operates directly on the matrix without creating a copy, optimizing for space complexity.

## Files

- `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`: Contains the main function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` that rotates a 2D matrix in place.
- `main_0.py`: A script to test the function with sample input.
