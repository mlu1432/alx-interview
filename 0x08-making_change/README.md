# Making Change
# Project Overview
- This project tackles the coin change problem, a classic problem in algorithm design that involves determining the fewest number of coins required to make a given amount of change, using a list of available denominations. This problem is often solved using dynamic programming or greedy algorithms, depending on the coin denominations.
