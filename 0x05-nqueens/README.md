# 0x05-nqueens

## Introduction

- The N Queens problem is a famous problem in computer science and mathematics. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

- This project implements a solution to the N Queens problem using the backtracking algorithm in Python. The program takes a single input argument N (the size of the chessboard) and prints all possible ways to place N non-attacking queens on the board.
